# Machine-Learning-Hello-Program
Hello World of Machine Learning
The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers (e.g. the iris dataset).

This is a good project because it is so well understood.

Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.
It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.

assumes Python version 2.7 or 3.5+.

There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install. Below is a list of the Python SciPy libraries required for this:
scipy, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn
